- LOF seems to be a promising approach, when combined with one hot encoding for categorical columns.
- 2101 columns are being generated after one hot encoding.
- can handle only 10% of the dataset at a time, since computing LOF is memory-expensive
- Need to do more research and come up with a way to evaluate this approach
- Please note that this is done on a sampled subset of the sataset (20% of the original)
